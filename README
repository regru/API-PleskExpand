API-PleskExpand version 1.00
=======================

The given module is intended for interaction with the XML API of the Plesk Expand centralized hosting panel. API is realized not completely, but there is a full support of operations with Account and Domains. 

API::PleskExpand module gives the convenient interface for addition of new functions. Extensions represent modules in a folder Expand with definitions of demanded functions. Each demanded operation is described by two functions: op and op_response_parse. The first sub generates XML query to Expand, the second is responsible for parse XML answer and its representation in Perl Native Structures. As a template for a writing of own expansions is better to use API/PleskExpand/Account.pm. In module API::Plesk::Methods (parent module) we can find service functions for a writing our extensions.
